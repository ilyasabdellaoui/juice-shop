# DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline for OWASP Juice Shop
[![DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline for OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/ilyasabdellaoui/juice-shop/actions/workflows/DevSecOps-pipeline.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ilyasabdellaoui/juice-shop/actions/workflows/DevSecOps-pipeline.yml)

This fork demonstrates a **DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline** for the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop), a vulnerable web application ideal for security training. The pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and integrates **security testing**, **vulnerability management**, and **automated redeployment**.

## Features & Pipeline Overview
1. **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD):**
   - Automates the deployment of the Juice Shop Docker image.
   - Verifies the health and accessibility of the deployed application.

2. **Integrated Security Testing:**
   - **SAST**: Uses [CodeQL](https://github.com/github/codeql) for static code analysis.
   - **SCA**: Uses [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
   - **DAST**: Employs [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) to perform runtime security tests.
   - Uploads security results as artifacts.

3. **Vulnerability Management:**
   - Combines and processes results into SARIF & XML reports.
   - Integrates with [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/).

4. **Automated Redeployment:**
   - Redeploys Juice Shop after codebase changes or vulnerability fixes.
